# tracking bot for hyperliquid futures

Any address you want from hyperliquid you can track in real time using telegram bot notifications.
Existing data will update every 12 hours (price, position size, leverage, profit/loss), new notifications when long/short is opened/closed

To make it works change telegram bot token to your own model, use @botfather to create your own bot first on telegram.
For 24/7 run it on linux vps (cheapest option on ubuntu) via bash.
If you want to run it locally for example via vscode you only need bot telegram token.
For vps: buy server (6$ per month depends where you live), install winscp and git
